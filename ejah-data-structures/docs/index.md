# &#128187; Ejah Data Structures Python Package

Welcome to the documentation for the **Ejah Data Structures Python** package. This Python package offers a collection of essential data structures including arrays, queues, stacks, linked lists, binary trees, and binary graph search implemented in Python for the purpose of learning and practice.

---

## &#x1F4BB; Modules

### &#x23A1; Array
Efficient dynamic array implementation with insert, delete, search, and traversal operations.

###  &#x1F4D2; Stack
A Stack stores items in a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order. This means the last item added is the first one to be removed.

### &#x1F4F2; Queue
A Queue stores items in a **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** order. This means the first item added is the first one to be removed.

### &#x21C4; Singly Linked List
A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next with insert, delete, search and traverse capabilities.

### &#x1F50D; Binary Search
A class-based binary search on sorted data with fast lookup.

### &#x1F332; Binary Tree
Binary Tree structure supporting traversal, insertion, and search.
